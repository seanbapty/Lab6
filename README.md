Lab6 Basic Robot Movement
====

#Objectives
This lab is designed to provide you with experience using the pulse-width modulation features of the MSP430. You will need to program the MSP430 to generate pulse-width-modulated waveforms to control the speed / direction of your robot's motors. In this lab, you will make your robot move forward, backwards, a small (< 45 degree) turn left/right, and a large (> 45 dgree) turn left/right.
