Lab6 Basic Robot Movement
====

#Objectives
This lab is designed to provide you with experience using the pulse-width modulation features of the MSP430. You will need to program the MSP430 to generate pulse-width-modulated waveforms to control the speed / direction of your robot's motors. In this lab, you will make your robot move forward, backwards, a small (< 45 degree) turn left/right, and a large (> 45 dgree) turn left/right.

#Preliminary Design
Prior to begining work on the lab, it was useful to think about the problem and layout how the MSP430 will be hooked up to the motor driver chip and therefore the electric motors. The electric motors will operate if there is a potential difference accross the motor. Therefore, each motor must have two inputs so that this difference can be created. Additionally, there are two motors on the robot and they are independently controlled to perform right/left hand turns. A rough schematic of what pins can be used on the MSP and the motor driver chip (SN754410) was drawn prior to wiring the connections or writing software.
